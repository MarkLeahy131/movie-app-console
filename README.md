# movie-app-console was created as part of my Software Tools Module. I chose a movies app because I wanted it to stand out from the notes app we used in the last assignment.

Features:

• Add Movies
• List Movies
• Select a Genre
• Select Director
• Select a Duration
• Give a Rating
• Save a Movie
• Load a Movie
